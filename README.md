# Dashboard Analysis & Summary
1. Dashboard Overview

This is a Dynamic Sales Dashboard designed to analyze business performance across multiple dimensions such as Sales, Orders, Quantity, and Profit. The dashboard also includes filters and quarterly sales analysis, which helps in interactive and time-based decision making.

2. Key Metrics Analysis

Sales:
Sales represent the total revenue generated over a selected period. By using filters, sales performance can be analyzed by quarter, category, or other dimensions. This helps identify high-performing and low-performing periods.

Orders:
Orders indicate the total number of transactions completed. A comparison between sales and orders helps understand customer purchasing patterns and average order value.

Quantity (QTY):
Quantity shows the total number of units sold. This metric is useful to analyze demand trends and product movement, especially when sales value and quantity do not increase at the same rate.

Profit:
Profit reflects the actual earnings after costs. This is one of the most important KPIs, as high sales do not always mean high profitability. The dashboard helps identify which quarters or segments are more profitable.
